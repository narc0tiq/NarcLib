This is a utility library for Minecraft mods.

It is designed to be used as a dependency when compiling and packaging
with [mcp_deobfuscate](https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_deobfuscate).

As a dependency, its source will be included in the resulting mod, and
it will not generate a binary. There is no download for this, just the
source.
